py-seccure Changelog
====================

0.3.4 (unreleased)
------------------

- Nothing changed yet.


0.3.3 (2019-04-28)
------------------

- Bow to flake8
- py-seccure did not pad a signature with zeroes as seccure expected.
  This caused some signatures generated by py-seccure not being accepted
  by seccure. This has been fixed.  Old unpadded signatures are still
  accepted by py-seccure to keep backwards compatibility.
  See #16 (Thanks-to: Tanner Collin)
